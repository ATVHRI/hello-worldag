Hello, Code:You and/or any other interested parties,

              My name is Andrew, and I am picking this class/program up as I initially failed to complete my studies back in college. I always felt bad about that, and feel I missed a lot of good opportunities by not completing my classes. Now, I am back to refresh what I already know and to learn more of what I don't. In my spare time, I like to make music, play games, and pretend to understand my dog when she yells at my girlfriend and I (we think we've figuresd certain tones of bark out).
